# reddit_image_uploader

## Installation

You need the Python3 and the `praw` package:

	% pip3 install praw

Then, move *reddit_image_uploader* wherever you like. I'm not interested
enough to make this a Python package.

## Run the program

Run the program:

	% reddit_image_uploader SUBREDDIT IMAGE_FILE TITLE

For example, you can use */r/test* to test it.

	% reddit_image_uploader test cat.jpg "This is my cat"

I use this a small part of a pipeline, so it doesn't need to do a lot.
